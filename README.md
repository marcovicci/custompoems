I made a disgusting web app that takes user input in three dropdown lists (gender, hair colour and eye colour), queries a database with pronouns and various poetic colour terms, and fills that data into song lyrics in order to allow you to answer questions like, “what if Jolene was a song about a man with green hair and white eyes?” 
OK, I’m going to be honest. I had some cool ideas for this and then the stresses of life caught up with me big-time. As a result this “web app” is basically unstyled, and lacks many, many features I would have wanted to implement. I’m submitting it because it’s better than nothing, and at least you can see where I’m going with this…
